Hello, we're "The Outliers". Please find below the code for the given Wholesale Price Index problem statement analysis.

From the statement, we understand that agricultural markets are influenced by multiple factors, including climate variability, supply chain disruptions, and economic conditions, which lead to unpredictable price fluctuations. Understanding and forecasting these price movements is crucial for farmers, traders, and policymakers to make informed decisions. While traditional models have been widely used for price prediction, they often struggle with capturing non-linear trends and sudden market shifts. With advancements in statistical and machine learning techniques, more sophisticated approaches can enhance forecasting accuracy. However, in this study, we analyze the wholesale price index (WPI) of potatoes from 1990 to 2024 and find that the traditional AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) model outperforms other predictive approaches. Despite the increasing interest in complex machine-learning models, ARMA proves to be the most effective in capturing price trends and fluctuations in our dataset. This highlights the continued relevance of classical time series models in agricultural price forecasting.
